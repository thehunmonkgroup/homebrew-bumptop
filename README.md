homebrew-bumptop
================

### Summary

An alternate [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io) tap for installing [Bumptop](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/BumpTop). Unfortunately the [official open source project](https://code.google.com/p/bumptop) is mostly dead, and their last *official* release doesn't work on newer versions of OS X.

However, before they closed their commercial site, there was a newer release which *does* still work, with some minor glitches on some OS X versions. This alternate tap makes use of that release, and will be available as long as it continues to work.

### Installing the Cask

```shell
brew tap thehunmonkgroup/homebrew-bumptop
brew cask install bumptop
```
